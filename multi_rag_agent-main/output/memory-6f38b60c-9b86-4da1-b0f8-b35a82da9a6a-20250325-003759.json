We strictly prohibit unlawful discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, veteran status, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, sex, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, mental or physical disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, or any other characteristics protected by law.

Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying\n\nGoogle prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying in any form \u2013 verbal, physical, or visual, as discussed more fully in our Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation. If you believe you've been bullied, harassed, or discriminated against by anyone at Google, or by a Google partner or vendor, we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to your supervisor, Human Resources or both. Similarly, supervisors and managers who learn of any such incident should immediately report it to Human Resources. Human Resources will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action.\n\n### 3. Drugs and Alcohol\n\nOur position on substance abuse is simple: It is incompatible with the health and safety of our employees, and we don't permit it. Consumption of alcohol is not banned at our offices, but use good judgment and never drink in a way that leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behavior, endangers the safety of others, or violates the law. Illegal drugs in our offices or at sponsored events are strictly prohibited. If a manager has reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee's use of drugs and/or alcohol may adversely affect the employee's job performance or the safety of the employee or others in the workplace, the manager may request an alcohol and/or drug screening.

Spending Google's Money\n\nA core Google value has always been to spend money wisely. When you submit an expense for reimbursement or spend money on Google's behalf, make sure that the cost is reasonable, directly related to company business, and supported by appropriate documentation. Always record the business purpose (e.g., if you take someone out to\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\ndinner on Google, always record in our expense reimbursement tool the full names and titles of the people who attended as well as the reason for the dinner) and comply with other submission requirements. If you're uncertain about whether you should spend money or submit an expense for reimbursement, check with your manager. Managers are responsible for all money spent and expenses incurred by their direct reports, and should carefully review such spend and expenses before approving.\n\n### Signing a Contract\n\nEach time you enter into a business transaction on Google's behalf, there should be documentation recording that agreement, approved by the Legal Department. Signing a contract on behalf of Google is a very big deal. Never sign any contract on behalf of Google unless all of the following are met:\n\n- You are authorized to do so under our Signature Authority and Approval Policy. If you are unsure whether you are authorized, ask your manager\n- The contract has been approved by Legal.

Employee Data\n\nWe collect and store personal information from employees around the world. Access this data only in line with local law and Google internal policies, and be sure to handle employee data in a manner that is consistent with Google's Data Classification and Employment Data Guidelines and other Google policies.\n\n# VI. Ensure Financial Integrity and Responsibility\n\nFinancial integrity and fiscal responsibility are core aspects of corporate professionalism. This is more than accurate reporting of our financials, though that's certainly important. The money we spend on behalf of Google is not ours; it's the company's and, ultimately, our shareholders'. Each person at Google \u2013 not just those in Finance \u2013 has a role in making sure that money is appropriately spent, our financial records are complete and accurate, and internal controls are honored. This matters every time we hire a new vendor, expense something to Google, sign a new business contract, or enter into any deals on Google's behalf.\n\nTo make sure that we get this right, Google maintains a system of internal controls to reinforce our compliance with legal, accounting, tax, and other regulatory requirements in every location in which we operate.\n\nStay in full compliance with our system of internal controls, and don't hesitate to contact Ethics & Business Integrity or Finance if you have any questions. What follows are some core concepts that lie at the foundation of financial integrity and fiscal responsibility here at Google.\n\n# 1.

Investments in venture capital or other similar funds that invest in a broad cross-section of companies that may include Google competitors or business partners generally do not create conflicts of interest. However, a conflict of interest may exist if you control the fund's investment activity.\n\nOutside Employment, Advisory Roles, Board Seats, and Starting Your Own Business Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Google competitors or business partners when your judgment could be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm Google. Additionally, because board seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager before accepting a board seat with any outside company. Google board members and employees who are VP and above should also notify Ethics & Business Integrity. Finally, do not start your own business if it will compete with Google.",

The Google Records Retention Policy suggests minimum record retention periods for certain types of records. These are great guidelines, but keep in mind that legal requirements, accounting rules, and other external sources sometimes specify longer retention periods for certain types of records, and those control where applicable. In addition, if asked by Legal to retain records relevant to a litigation, audit, or investigation, do so until Legal tells you retention is no longer necessary. If you have any questions regarding the correct length of time to retain a record, contact the Records Retention Team.\n\n# VII. Obey the Law\n\nGoogle takes its responsibilities to comply with laws and regulations very seriously and each of us is expected to comply with applicable legal requirements and prohibitions. While it's impossible for anyone to know all aspects of every applicable law, you should understand the major laws and regulations that apply to your work. Take advantage of Legal and Ethics & Business Integrity to assist you here. A few specific laws are easy to violate unintentionally and so are worth pointing out here:",

If you are unsure whether you are authorized, ask your manager\n- The contract has been approved by Legal. If you are using an approved Google form contract, you don't need further Legal approval unless you have made changes to the form contract or are using it for other than its intended purpose\n- You have studied the contract, understood its terms and decided that entering into the contract is in Google's interest\n\nAll contracts at Google should be in writing and should contain all of the relevant terms to which the parties are agreeing \u2013 Google does not permit \"side agreements,\" oral or written.\n\n# 2.
