We strictly prohibit unlawful discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, veteran status, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, sex, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, mental or physical disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, or any other characteristics protected by law.

Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying\n\nGoogle prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying in any form \u2013 verbal, physical, or visual, as discussed more fully in our Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation. If you believe you've been bullied, harassed, or discriminated against by anyone at Google, or by a Google partner or vendor, we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to your supervisor, Human Resources or both. Similarly, supervisors and managers who learn of any such incident should immediately report it to Human Resources. Human Resources will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action.\n\n### 3. Drugs and Alcohol\n\nOur position on substance abuse is simple: It is incompatible with the health and safety of our employees, and we don't permit it. Consumption of alcohol is not banned at our offices, but use good judgment and never drink in a way that leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behavior, endangers the safety of others, or violates the law. Illegal drugs in our offices or at sponsored events are strictly prohibited. If a manager has reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee's use of drugs and/or alcohol may adversely affect the employee's job performance or the safety of the employee or others in the workplace, the manager may request an alcohol and/or drug screening.

Spending Google's Money\n\nA core Google value has always been to spend money wisely. When you submit an expense for reimbursement or spend money on Google's behalf, make sure that the cost is reasonable, directly related to company business, and supported by appropriate documentation. Always record the business purpose (e.g., if you take someone out to\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\ndinner on Google, always record in our expense reimbursement tool the full names and titles of the people who attended as well as the reason for the dinner) and comply with other submission requirements. If you're uncertain about whether you should spend money or submit an expense for reimbursement, check with your manager. Managers are responsible for all money spent and expenses incurred by their direct reports, and should carefully review such spend and expenses before approving.\n\n### Signing a Contract\n\nEach time you enter into a business transaction on Google's behalf, there should be documentation recording that agreement, approved by the Legal Department. Signing a contract on behalf of Google is a very big deal. Never sign any contract on behalf of Google unless all of the following are met:\n\n- You are authorized to do so under our Signature Authority and Approval Policy. If you are unsure whether you are authorized, ask your manager\n- The contract has been approved by Legal.

We set the bar that high for practical as well as aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us hire great people, build great products, and attract loyal users.

It's built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct. We set the bar that high for practical as well as aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us hire great people, build great products, and attract loyal users. Respect for our users, for the opportunity, and for each other are foundational to our success, and are something we need to support every day.\n\nSo please do read the Code and Google's values, and follow both in spirit and letter, always bearing in mind that each of us has a personal responsibility to incorporate, and to encourage other Googlers to incorporate, the principles of the Code and values into our work. And if you have a question or ever think that one of your fellow Googlers or the company as a whole may be falling short of our commitment, don't be silent. We want \u2013 and need \u2013 to hear from you.\n\n### Who Must Follow Our Code?\n\nWe expect all of our employees and Board members to know and follow the Code. Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment. Moreover, while the Code is specifically written for Google employees and Board members, we expect members of our extended workforce (temps, vendors, and independent contractors) and others who may be temporarily assigned to perform work or services for Google to follow the Code in connection with their work for us. Failure of a member of our extended workforce or other covered service provider to follow the Code can result in termination of their relationship with Google.\n\nEmployees and extended workforce members must complete in a timely fashion all trainings that are required for their roles.\n\n### What If I Have a Code-Related Question or Concern?\n\nIf you have",

You should also consider 1) any overlap between your specific role at Google and the company's business, 2) the significance of the investment, including the size of the investment in relation to your net worth, 3) whether the investment is in a public or private company, 4) your ownership percentage of the company, and 5) the extent to which the investment gives you the ability to manage and control the company. Investments in venture capital or other similar funds that invest in a broad cross-section of companies that may include Google competitors or business partners generally do not create conflicts of interest. However, a conflict of interest may exist if you control the fund's investment activity.\n\nOutside Employment, Advisory Roles, Board Seats, and Starting Your Own Business Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Google competitors or business partners when your judgment could be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm Google. Additionally, because board seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager before accepting a board seat with any outside company. Google board members and employees who are VP and above should also notify Ethics & Business Integrity. Finally, do not start your own business if it will compete with Google.",
