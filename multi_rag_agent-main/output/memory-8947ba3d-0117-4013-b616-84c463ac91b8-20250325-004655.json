We strictly prohibit unlawful discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, veteran status, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, sex, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, mental or physical disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, or any other characteristics protected by law.

Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying\n\nGoogle prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying in any form \u2013 verbal, physical, or visual, as discussed more fully in our Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation. If you believe you've been bullied, harassed, or discriminated against by anyone at Google, or by a Google partner or vendor, we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to your supervisor, Human Resources or both. Similarly, supervisors and managers who learn of any such incident should immediately report it to Human Resources. Human Resources will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action.\n\n### 3. Drugs and Alcohol\n\nOur position on substance abuse is simple: It is incompatible with the health and safety of our employees, and we don't permit it. Consumption of alcohol is not banned at our offices, but use good judgment and never drink in a way that leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behavior, endangers the safety of others, or violates the law. Illegal drugs in our offices or at sponsored events are strictly prohibited. If a manager has reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee's use of drugs and/or alcohol may adversely affect the employee's job performance or the safety of the employee or others in the workplace, the manager may request an alcohol and/or drug screening.

You should also consider 1) any overlap between your specific role at Google and the company's business, 2) the significance of the investment, including the size of the investment in relation to your net worth, 3) whether the investment is in a public or private company, 4) your ownership percentage of the company, and 5) the extent to which the investment gives you the ability to manage and control the company. Investments in venture capital or other similar funds that invest in a broad cross-section of companies that may include Google competitors or business partners generally do not create conflicts of interest. However, a conflict of interest may exist if you control the fund's investment activity.\n\nOutside Employment, Advisory Roles, Board Seats, and Starting Your Own Business Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Google competitors or business partners when your judgment could be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm Google. Additionally, because board seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager before accepting a board seat with any outside company.

          "text": "{5}------------------------------------------------\n### Personal Investments\n\nAvoid making personal investments in companies that are Google competitors or business partners when the investment might cause, or appear to cause, you to act in a way that could harm Google.\n\nWhen determining whether a personal investment creates a conflict of interest, consider the relationship between the business of the outside company, Google's business, and what you do at Google, including whether the company has a business relationship with Google that you can influence, and the extent to which the company competes with Google. You should also consider 1) any overlap between your specific role at Google and the company's business, 2) the significance of the investment, including the size of the investment in relation to your net worth, 3) whether the investment is in a public or private company, 4) your ownership percentage of the company, and 5) the extent to which the investment gives you the ability to manage and control the company. Investments in venture capital or other similar funds that invest in a broad cross-section of companies that may include Google competitors or business partners generally do not create conflicts of interest. However, a conflict of interest may exist if you control the fund's investment activity.\n\nOutside Employment, Advisory Roles, Board Seats, and Starting Your Own Business Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Google competitors or business partners when your judgment could be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm Google. Additionally, because board seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager before accepting a board seat with any outside company. Google board members and employees who are VP and above should also notify Ethics & Business Integrity. Finally, do not start your own business if it will compete with Google.",
